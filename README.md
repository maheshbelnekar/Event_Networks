# Event Networks

Event Networks is an Android social media application for users to create, update and join events. 

## Motivation
At Indiana University we are accustomed to receive multiple events every week my each club inviting students to join the events and also providing information about the same.
This can quickly get out of hand as number of events and clubs increase. This is problematic to both, students and organizing committees.
The above scenario is not just limited to a college or workplace but also in people’s day to day lives. Event Networks can solving this problem.
